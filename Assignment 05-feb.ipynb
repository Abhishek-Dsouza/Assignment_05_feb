    "#### Answer :-\n",
    "#### Class - A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that all objects of that class will have. A class can be thought of as a cookie cutter that is used to create identical cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object - An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a specific realization of the class, with its own set of attribute values. Each object is unique and has its own state and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, consider a class called \"Person\". This class can have attributes such as \"name\", \"age\", \"gender\", and methods such as \"walk\", \"talk\", \"eat\". We can create multiple objects of this class, each with its own set of attribute values, such as:"

    "#### Answer:-\n",
    "#### 1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, such as a class. This helps to hide the complexity of the implementation and makes it easier to modify and maintain the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details while showing only the necessary information to the user. This helps to reduce the complexity of the system and makes it easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Inheritance: Inheritance is the process of creating a new class by deriving properties and characteristics from an existing class. This helps to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes with shared properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, this means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were of the same class, as long as they implement the same methods. This helps to write flexible and reusable code."
